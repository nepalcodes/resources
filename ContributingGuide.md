# Contributing Guide

This document describes how we contribute in NepalCodes. 

### GIT

We work with git at a higher level. Git can be complicated but we try to keep it simple by following [git feature branch workflow by atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

- If you are not familiar with GIT, here's the [simple git guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).
